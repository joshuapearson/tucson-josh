Hi, I'm Joshua Pearson, thanks for visiting.
I'm a 20+ year veteran of the software industry. Over that time I've seen booms
and busts ranging from the dot-com crash to the current AI craze. Creating
software has always been more than just a job for me and is something that I am
passionate about. This site gives me a chance to write about the things I've
learned as well as the new and exciting discoveries that come about every day.

Software isn't my only passion, though. Photography has also been a big part of
my life for a long time and I wanted to create a place where I can write about
it. Social media has made it easy to share the images that we create, but seems
poorly suited to discussions of process and creativity.

So, this site ends up playing host to two fields that are quite disparate. But
that's life, I suppose: random things brought together in time and space.

### Software Engineering

Most of my career has been spent developing web and mobile applications. In the
earliest days this meant PHP that talked to a variety of custom back ends or
Oracle databases. From there it was on to Java and SQL server. Lots of Javascript
kept forcing its way into my life too. A few years of writing iOS apps in Swift
got me hooked on high performance languages that still offer a great developer
experience. All of those adventures eventually led me to try out
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which feels like the current champion of
high performance with excellent ergonomics.

Of course, software is about a lot more than just programming languages. There's
a whole ecosystem that is needed to solve most problems. One of the most
important parts of that ecosystem is how you store and interact with your data.
I want to share my thoughts on some of the more interesting tools in this space
that I've started using. Tools like [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) and
[Apache Preset](https://preset.io/) are really remarkable tools that I feel need
more exposure.

### Photography

When I'm not clacking away at my keyboard, chances are pretty high that I'm
peering though the viewfinder of a camera. I am a photojournalist for the
[Tucson Sentinel](https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/), a local non-profit news
organization. I also do a lot of personal work ranging from wildlife and travel
photography to portraiture. If you'd like to keep up with my most recent work,
you can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tucson.josh/).
