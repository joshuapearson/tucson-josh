## There are a few ways to reach out to me, depending on what platform you're on:

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/tucson-josh.bsky.social) - Send me a
message on Bluesky. I'm usually pretty quick to respond here.
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tucson.josh/) - Drop me a message on
Instagram, especially if you want to discuss photography-related content.
Probably the fastest way to get a response out of me too.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pearsonjoshua/) - You can also message
me on LinkedIn. I rarely check my messages there, though, so this is the least
reliable way to contact me.
