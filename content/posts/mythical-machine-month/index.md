The software industry is in the midst of an identity crisis. The biggest
companies in the field are laying off experienced workers by the thousands and
new college grads are struggling to even land interviews. A profession which had
only experienced growth for more than two decades now fears a bleak future and
sees question marks over where it's headed. The catalyst for all of this is the
rise of generative AI, with some big corporate leaders making
[claims](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-cto-ai-generated-code-software-developer-job-change-2025-4)
that 95% of code will be written by AI by the end of the decade. Could this come
to pass, and if so, where does that leave software engineers?

### The Siren Song

There's a clear reason why generative AI is such a hot topic in the software
industry right now: it can spin out huge amounts of novel source code in very
little time. More tempting still, the interface to this whole process is just
plain old English (or whatever language you speak that the system understands).
You just tell the AI that you want a program that does some particular thing and
it returns back code that is supposed to do said thing. If you put yourself into
the shoes of an executive, this doesn't seem very different from how software
has been made for decades.

### How the Sausage is Made

Thoughtful observers have been documenting the challenges of software engineering for many
years, even codifying best practices for developing software system products.

Does the advent of tools that can produce source code at superhuman speed threaten the
continued existence of programmers, or will we see some evolved version of
Brook's law governing the addition of AI agents to software projects?

The question that needs to be answered is whether the shaking we feel in the
ground is an earthquake releasing pressure built up along these fault lines or
if it's a shockwave from Chicxulub and we are the dinosaurs in our last days.

### AI vs Compiled Languages

You aren't asked to check the assembly produced by your compiler.
