title: "Capturing Decisive Moments on the Trail" # Title of the blog post.

summary: "Photography and backpacking have been intertwined ever since cameras
  were light enough to lug up a trail. Even as our tools become ever more
  compact, though, the challenge of capturing fleeting moments remains. If your
  gear is stashed away in a backpack, good luck catching wildlife that soars by.
  Conversely, a camera dangling from your neck is a constant nuisance,
  threatening to bang into rocks and trees. But maybe the solution has been
  draped over our shoulders all along."
